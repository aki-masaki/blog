<p>Oftentimes, we get lost staring at a screen, just a grid of pixels immitating what's real, while outside sits such beautiful wonders that God created and He also gave us eyes so we could appreciate His beauty.</p>
<p>From my experience atleast, my inner feelings reflect the place I'm in, if I sit between four walls, then my soul is also delimited by the walls of the flesh, which more than often is lazy, rushed and doesn't want to carry the Cross. But by going out the door, and learning to see reality itself, not an immitation, my soul also is set free from the chains of the flesh permitting me to learn discipline and patience.</p>
<p>We are so focused on where we step, that we forget to look at the sky that God beautifully paints and trust Him that He will align our steps on the right path. Much worry distracts us from the main objective. By moving our focus on Him, all of our worries go and we're left with an inner peace nothing else could bring us.</p>
<p>I tried many ways to reduce useless technology from my life, like scrolling TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, by uninstalling or setting limits. But then I would find myself installing them again or changing the limits to allow more time. Only when I gave up those as a gift to God and by feeling His presence always with me, could I unleash myself from corporational money scheme. Social media is designed to give you what you want to see, in turn generating dopamine in the brain which addicts it so we could spend more time on them, making more money for the corporations.</p>
<p>May God nudge us all to go outside, it all starts with a nudge from Him, but He also gives us the choice: follow Him or not? If your answer is yes, then you also must <em>take action</em>. What use is for a tree, other than to bear fruit? Ask Him for strength, and He will give you strength. God bless.</p>
