  my first post
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-12-13</strong></p>
<p>this is my first blog post. this is the start of something new, i never had a blog before, but wouldn't life be boring living the same day without longing for new knowlegde?</p>
<p>if im being honest, slothness is one of the sins i struggle with the most, in the evening i tell myself the next day will be full of productive work and when it comes my mind is tired and my body paralyzed. starting this blog is trying a new way to battle sloth, because it will make work enjoyable from the beginning ("i cant wait to learn this so i can write a blog post about it")</p>
<p>i still dont know if this method will work, but what hurts to try?</p>
<p>making this blog public is a way to battle my fear of human judgement, something i struggled with since childhood. i still dont know the cause, but in specific situations, i feel a compelling need to flee from there and be forgotten. my mind goes blank and my body feels heavy. but the truth is human approval (in the sense of <em>not</em> being rejected by <em>anyone</em>) doesn't matter much in comparison to God's approval.</p>
<p>the Bible teaches us: "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." (Matthew 10:28)</p>
